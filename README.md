## Open Genus Foundation Software Development Internship

During my internship at [OpenGenus Foundation](https://github.com/OpenGenus) as a Software Development Intern, I have composed articles in the field of Software Development.

Here are the links for the articles:<br>

<br> Link to my Open Genus profile [MayankPatel-OpenGenus](https://iq.opengenus.org/author/mayank-patel/)<br><br>
I have written these articles after a careful study on the topic and it surely was a really good experience. Content writing exapands your thinking capabilities and with the ever increasing need of communication skills, content writing gives a really good opportunity for one to hone these skills. <br><br> Any contribution is appreciated. Hope you found these articles insightful and helful ;).
